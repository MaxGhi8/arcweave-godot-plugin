## About

As a PhD student in Mathematics, I’ve experienced firsthand the pressure, uncertainty, and occasional absurdity of academic life. I wanted to capture those moments—both serious and humorous—and share them through an interactive, narrative format.

**PhD Game** is a choice-based story where players experience the rollercoaster of pursuing a PhD, one decision at a time.
